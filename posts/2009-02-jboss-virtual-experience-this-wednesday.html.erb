<p>As time draws nigh, I once again want to remind everyone to <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/register.php' title='Register for the JBoss Virtual Experience'><strong>go register</strong></a> for the <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/' title='JBoss Virtual Experience'>JBoss Virtual Experience</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/agenda.php' title='JBVE Agenda'>3 simultaneous tracks</a>: <strong>Business</strong>, <strong>Technical</strong> and <strong>Goverment</strong>.&nbsp; A lot of JBoss engineers and business people will be around for Q&amp;A after each presentation, plus there's a virtual cafe where folks can linger for informal conversation.</p>
<p>My presentation goes on at 3pm US-Eastern.</p>
<p>It should be fun.</p>
