<p>I'll be presenting on <a href='/theses/jboss-rails' title='JBoss-Rails'>JBoss-Rails</a> and <a href='/theses/jboss-cloud' title='JBoss-Cloud'>JBoss-Cloud</a> at the <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/' title='JBoss Virtual Experience'>JBoss Virtual Experience</a>.</p>
<p>It's like a conference, but free, and you can attend in your slippers, since it's "virtual".</p>
<p>Plan on attending on February 11th, from 8:30am through 6:00pm to <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/agenda.php' title='JBVE Agenda'>hear speakers</a> in 3 different tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Technical</li>
</ul>
<p>The JBVE guys are also tweeting as <a href='http://twitter.com/jbossvirtexp' title='jbossvirtexp on Twitter'>@jbossvirtexp</a>.&nbsp; Follow'em to stay informed.</p>
