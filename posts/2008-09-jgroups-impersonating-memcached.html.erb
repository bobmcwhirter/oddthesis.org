<p>I woke up and noticed that a <a href='http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/memcached/memcached.html' title='JGroups: memcached'>memcached mode</a> was announced by Bela Ban, the fantastically Swiss man who jogs waaay too much.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of things in this world that can take advantage of memcached.  Personally, I find this quite interesting, considering that memcached tends to be the cache-of-choice for lots of non-Java languages.  For instance, fragment caching and model caching in Rails supports talking to memcached.</p>
<p>Or now, <a href='http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/index.html' title='JGroups'>JGroups</a>.</p>
