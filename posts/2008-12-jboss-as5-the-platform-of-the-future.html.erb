<p>Oh happy day!</p>
<p><a title="Dimitris's announcement" href="http://dandreadis.blogspot.com/2008/12/jbossas-500ga-released.html">Dimitris announced</a> that JBoss AS 5.0-GA (the community edition) has been released.&nbsp; For a while (years?) people have been asking where AS5 is.&nbsp; Well, it's...</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 120%;"><a title="JBoss AS 5 GA, no joke." href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/">RIGHT HERE</a></p>
<p>Go ahead and grab it.&nbsp; It's awesome.&nbsp; Plus it's the foundation for your cool new Ruby on Rails apps (once you install the <a title="JBoss-Rails Deployer" href="/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails">JBoss-Rails Deployer</a>).</p>
<p>The supported <a title="JBoss EAP" href="http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application">EAP</a> flavor of AS5 will be released in the next several months.</p>
