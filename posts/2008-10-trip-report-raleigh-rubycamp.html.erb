<p>I did the round-trip from the land of cows to Raleigh to attend the <a title="Raleigh RubyCamp" href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp" mce_href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp">Raleigh RubyCamp</a> over the weekend.</p>
<p>I think I heard about 80 folks showed up, but I&#8217;m not certain on that.</p>
<p>Mark (root@37s) and <a title="James's Blog" href="http://infozerk.com/averyblog/" mce_href="http://infozerk.com/averyblog/">James</a> did a very nice job of organizing it.&nbsp; They provided good coffee and donuts to start the morning right.&nbsp; Krispy Kreme is never a bad idea.</p>
<p>We gathered, and a handful of folks presented introductions about what they wanted to do a session on.&nbsp; We then figured out the slots, and got started.</p>
<p><a title="Brenton's Blog" href="http://exawkuser.blogspot.com/" mce_href="http://exawkuser.blogspot.com/">Brenton Leanhardt</a> talked about <a title="Genome" href="http://genome.et.redhat.com/" mce_href="http://genome.et.redhat.com/">Genome</a> and <a title="Cobbler" href="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler" mce_href="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler">Cobbler</a>, two <a title="Red Hat ET" href="http://et.redhat.com/page/Main_Page" mce_href="http://et.redhat.com/page/Main_Page">emerging technologies</a> at Red Hat.&nbsp; Cobbler helps to stitch together distributions, Kickstarts and repositories, while Genome helps manage the inventory of virtualization hardware and the guest instances running on them.</p>
<p>His use-case for the technologies is the fact that we&#8217;ve got Xen hosts running on machines scattered under desks and in closets, which have been donated to a virtual pool.</p>
<p>Where did you launch that instance last month?&nbsp; Where can you launch a new instance today?&nbsp; Genome helps answer those questions.&nbsp; Many of the Genome bits are Camping apps.</p>
<p>I presented my short slide-deck about JBoss-Rails.</p>
<p><a title="Mark's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/markimbriaco" mce_href="http://twitter.com/markimbriaco">Mark Imbriaco</a> led an open discussion about Rails deployments.&nbsp; It ended up mostly being us asking how 37signals did things.&nbsp; He described their hosting environment, their occasional frustrations with Mongrel, along with some stories about running migrations against a 100gig database.</p>
<p><a title="Sean Cribbs" href="http://seancribbs.com/" mce_href="http://seancribbs.com/">Sean Cribbs</a> talked about his experience in joining and then leading open-source projects, particularly <a title="Radiant CMS" href="http://radiantcms.org/" mce_href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant CMS</a>.&nbsp; He discussed breaking up the core into <a title="Radiant on GitHub" href="http://github.com/radiant" mce_href="http://github.com/radiant">many plugins and modules</a>, and the uptick in community participation that followed.</p>
<p>Overall it was a great weekend, and I even got some nice t-shirts out of it.&nbsp; Not bad.</p>
