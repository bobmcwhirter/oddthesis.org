<p>I'm happy to announce after quite a lag, there's a new version of JBoss-Rails available with lots of new features. Just in time for playing with it over the weekend!</p>
<p>This release sees a solidification of the <a href='/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails/pages/job-scheduling' title='Job Scheduling'><strong>Job Scheduling</strong></a> component, along with the addition of the <a href='/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails/pages/ruby-soap-endpoints' title='Ruby SOAP Endpoints'><strong>Ruby SOAP Endpoints</strong></a> component.&nbsp; The SOAP stuff also brings along support for <a href='/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails/pages/crypto-yml' title='crypto.yml'>cyrptographic keystores</a> and XML-to-Ruby-to-XML databinding.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've upgraded the version of JRuby (1.2RC1 now) and removed a dependency on JRuby-Rack.</p>
<p><strong>New and updated <a href='/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails/pages/documentation' title='JBoss-Rails Documentation'>documentation</a> now exists.</strong></p>
<p>We've also created a <a href='/theses/jboss-rails/projects/jboss-rails/pages/your-first-app-on-jboss-rails' title='Your first Rails App on JBoss Rails'>"My first Rails App(tm)" walk-through</a> to get you started on that weekend project of doing a mash-up between your sprinkler-system and Twitter.</p>
