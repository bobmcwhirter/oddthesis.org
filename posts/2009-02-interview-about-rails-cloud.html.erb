<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke to Nitin Bharti at DZone/JavaLobby about JBoss-Rails and JBoss-Cloud.</p>
<p>They've now published the <a href='http://java.dzone.com/articles/odd-theses-an-interview-with-b' title='Interview for DZone'>mostly-accurate transcript</a>. You can also hear it <a href='http://java.dzone.com/sites/all/files/MP3_Bob%20Mcwhirther.mp3.zip' title='Audio interview for DZone'>straight from the horse's mouth</a> (MP3, zipped?).</p>
<p>Don't forget, you'll also be able to attend my presentation at the <a href='http://www-2.virtualevents365.com/jboss_experience/' title='JBoss Virtual Experience'>JBoss Virtual Experience</a> on February 11th.</p>
