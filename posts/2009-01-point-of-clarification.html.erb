<p>As Marek Goldmann points out <a href='http://javavsme.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/jboss-cloud/' title='Marek Goldmann&apos;s JBoss-Cloud post'>in his post about JBoss-Cloud</a>, the project is by no means tied to the JBoss-Rails project.&nbsp; (He's also blogged about JBoss mod_cluster both in <a href='http://javavsme.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/mod_cluster-nowe-spojrzenie-na-load-balancery/' title='Marek Goldmann on mod_cluster (Polish)'>Polish</a> and <a href='http://javavsme.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/fresh-mod_cluster-rpms-for-fedora-10/' title='Marek Goldmann on mod_cluster (English)'>English</a>.)&nbsp; He's also provided patches to our RPM spec files.&nbsp; Thanks Marek!</p>
<p>Even though both projects share a site (<a href='/' title='Bob&apos;s Odd Thesis'>Odd Thesis</a>) and a developer (me), they are not intrinsincly linked.&nbsp; I do want to run my Rails apps in the cloud, but JBoss-Cloud supports any and all of JBoss.&nbsp; If you've got a Seam app, go for it.</p>
<p>I now return you to your regularly-scheduled programming.</p>
