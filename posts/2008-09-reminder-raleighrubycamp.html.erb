<p>Don&#8217;t forget, in a few weeks at the <a href='http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html' title='Red Hat in Raleigh'>Red Hat offices in Raleigh</a>, there will be an unconference-style <a href='http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp' title='RaleighRubyCamp'>Ruby BarCamp</a> on October 18th.</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'><a href='http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/RaleighRubyCamp'><img class='aligncenter size-medium wp-image-535' title='raleigh-rubycamp' src='/images/archive/raleigh-rubycamp-300x106.png' height='106' alt='' width='300'/></a></p>
<p>My plan is to put together a few clumps of slides, prepare a cluster on EC2, and see if anyone wants to hear about JBoss Rails.Â  I&#8217;ll of course put them online sometimes before/during/after the camp, since that&#8217;s <a href='http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/TheRulesOfBarCamp' title='BarCamp rules'>part of the rules</a>.</p>
